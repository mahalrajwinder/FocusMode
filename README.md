# FocusMode
One of the most common excuses among students for not completing assignments is that they get distracted while studying. This distraction can be stressful and can lead to a poor understanding of concepts. Thus, we come up with an iOS app, called FocusMode, that helps students not only concentrate better while studying, but helps them improve their long-term study habits.

FocusMode continuously tracks the study habits of its users and then builds a personal model to improve their study habits by recommending them for personalized study sessions, including the most suitable place to study.
